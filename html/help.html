                            <span class="highlight-join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br>
                            <br>
                            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="highlight-join">Join</span> leverages the principles of
                            kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br>
                            <br>
